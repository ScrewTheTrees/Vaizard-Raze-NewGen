New Version of vaizard raze, featuring a better Entity and Online Sync engine.
Now also on github i guess, but thats hardly an improvement tbh, it only provides open shit to everyone to steal shit.
Maybe you can learn something from it like code structure, inheritance, or 39dll with UDP holepunching.


To edit, Required ToEdit:  Game Maker: Studio Proffesional, Latest version. Doesnt work on free version
To play, Runtime\ Features the .exe and its required files.

Vaizard raze is a game written by a swede in his underwear and a shitton of noodels & energy drinks.
This Swede does not like coffee, which is very rare for a programmer and he should probably learn to drink it.
Engine requires excessive amounts of Metal music to properly work.
