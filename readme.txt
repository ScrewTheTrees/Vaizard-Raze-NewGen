New Version of vaizard raze, featuring a better Entity and Online Sync engine.
Now also on github i guess, but thats hardly an improvement tbh, it only provides open shit to everyone to steal shit.
Maybe you can learn something from it like code structure, inheritance, or 39dll with UDP holepunching.


Reccomended to edit:  Game Maker: Studio Proffesional, Latest version. Doesnt work on free version
Can be edited with text editors but cannot be compiled this way.

To play, Runtime\ Features the .exe and its required files.

Vaizard raze is a game written by a swede in his underwear and a shitton of noodels & energy drinks.
This Swede does not like coffee, which is very rare for a programmer and he should probably learn to drink it.
Engine requires excessive amounts of Metal music to properly work.

The idea of the game is a sidescrolling platformer for several players with random generated maps and hard bosses.
The engine's Entity system was designed in such a way that players can take control of any unit (including bosses).
This systems intent was so that i could technically make gamemodes where players face each other in versus and players can control enemies on the fly to halt the progress of the other team of players.
Also allows for control of bosses and similar.... you get the point, its versatile.
Several player Classes are planned aswell, each with their own weapons and abilities, also planned for ability slots for player customization.
