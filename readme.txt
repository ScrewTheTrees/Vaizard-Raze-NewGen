New Version of vaizard raze, featuring a better Entity and Online Sync engine.
Now also on github i guess, but thats hardly an improvement tbh, it only provides open shit to everyone to steal shit.

To edit, Game Maker: Studio latest version is reccomended.
To play, Runtime\ Features the .exe and its required files.

Vaizard raze is a game written by a swede in his underwear and a shitton of noodels & energy drinks.
This Swede does not like coffee, which is very rare for a programmer and he should probably learn to drink it.
